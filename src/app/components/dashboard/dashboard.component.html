      Everyone feels sad or low sometimes, but these feelings usually pass with a little time. 
      Depression (also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is different. 
      It can cause severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.
      It is an illness that can affect anyoneâ€”regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. 
      Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression.

      Depression may occur with other mental disorders and other illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and chronic pain.
      Depression can make these conditions worse, and vice versa. 
      Sometimes medications taken for these illnesses cause side effects that contribute to depression symptoms.
      </span>

    <span class="show-text">
      To be diagnosed with depression, an individual must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least 2 weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities. 
      Children and adolescents may be irritable rather than sad.

      If you think you may have depression, talk to your health care provider. 
      Primary care providers routinely diagnose and treat depression and refer individuals to mental health professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists.</span>
